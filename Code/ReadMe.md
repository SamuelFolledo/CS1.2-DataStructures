# Tweet Generator

## What It Does
1. Use a Python script to __randomly generate words__ from a dictionary.
2. __Build sentences__ by sampling these words using a [Markov language model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_model).
3. __Implement grammar rules__ parsed from the text of a large document set.
4. __Build data structures__ including linked lists, hash tables, stacks, queues, and heaps __to store the words and sentences__.
5. Analyze the __inner workings and performance tradeoffs__ of each data structure.
6. __Deploy__ your language model to a Flask web server on Heroku and connect it to Twitter to let users tweet their favorite results.

## Learning Outcomes
- master Python __data structures__ and __data processing algorithms__
- implement data structures including __linked lists, hash tables, stacks, queues and heaps__
- __parse text documents__ and __store information__ in data structures
- implement __sampling methods__ and __Markov chains on data sets__
